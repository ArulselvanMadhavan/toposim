* Groundrules
- Each link is served by two signals
- A signal is monitored for events like connecting, ready, send, receive, complete
- Terminals and switches are numbered
- Switch are numbered first
- terminals are assigned a number -> switch_count + (terminal_count * switch_id) + term_idx
* XPU
- Each XPU is responsible for establishing uplink connection
- Each XPU is responsible for accepting downlink connection
- Add conn type
* HyperX
- P = number of switches
- n = number of dims
- T = number of terminals
- N = number of nodes = (P * T)
- (T, M, K, n)
